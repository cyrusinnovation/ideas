These are notes for getting set up with psql for ideas on
Lion. YMMV on other OSes.

Run the following port installs and do all of the things the installer
output tells you to do (create a db file and add postgres to launchd):

$ port install postgresql90
$ port install postgresql90-server

For some reason, port doesn't automatically add all the commands to
your path properly, to make it add them:

$ sudo port select postgresql postgresql90

Then you'll need to create the ideas role with the password '123':

$ createuser ideas -U postgres -P

Then you should be able to create the db

$ rake db:migrate
