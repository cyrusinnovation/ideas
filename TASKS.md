DONE
----
* Make the non-print estimation view a little more compact.
* Consider whether the Story Card visual metaphor is actually helpful here.
    Outcome: it's actually great for printing, but not so much for the screen.
* Set up a print stylesheet that uses the story card metaphor.
* Get rid of the story card metaphor in the screen stylesheet, and replace it with lists of stories per group.
* See if it's possible to have a single heading per group in the screen stylesheet, instead of repeating per story.
* Hide navigation chrome in print stylesheet.
* Consider taking out the number of stories control, and just always showing nine stories per group.
* Review the print stylesheet to make sure it looks good.
* Review the screen stylesheet to make sure it looks good.

TODO
----
* While you're at it, maybe look over the print views for the other pages too?
* Do we need a class to represent an estimation example group, rather than just using an array?
* Is it time to pull out an Estimate value object? And is that actually a workable move right now?
