TODO
----
* Set up a print stylesheet that uses the story card metaphor.
* Get rid of the story card metaphor in the screen stylesheet.
* See if it's possible to have a single heading per group in the screen stylesheet, instead of repeating per story.
* Hide navigation chrome in print stylesheet.
* Review the print stylesheet to make sure it looks good.
* Review the screen stylesheet to make sure it looks good.
* While you're at it, maybe look over the print views for the other pages too?
