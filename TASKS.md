TODO

* Add buttons to quickly mark a story started or finished today.
* Edit stories in bulk.
* Make up and down arrows work nicely when bulk editing stories.
* Show editable dates in m/d/yyyy format, instead of yyyy-mm-dd
* Accept broader range of date formats (there's a gem for this, isn't there?)
